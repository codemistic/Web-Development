A project I made to try my hands on Firebase.
Please Use your own Firebase API Key and Firebase Project ID in the code(firebase.js).(I have removed mine for security reasons)
You can Login and Signup using an email and password.
You can also add a profile picture.
You can also add your posts and see other posts.
Support for Google and Facebook login and Post Actions coming soon.(Fingers crossed)
Made with React and Firebase.
