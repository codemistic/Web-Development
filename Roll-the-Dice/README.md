# Behind the scences
<p>Logic behind this game is implemented using Javscript.</p>
Let's see how this is done:
Every time a new number on the dice can be achieved using random number generation.
Random numbers can be generated using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp">Math.random( )</a> function present in javascript.
<p>Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive),  and 1 (exclusive).</p>
