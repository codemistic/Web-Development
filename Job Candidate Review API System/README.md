#Job Candidate Review System

APIs and backend built in python using Django REST Framework and Djano Framework respectively
Two main models 
1)User Profile - Users who are looking for jobs first need to register
2)Job Application - Registered Users can apply for job

When you open the homepage (localhost/job_apply/job_applications), you can either fetch all the applicants or create a new candidate+application

For fetching , press GET APPLICANTS
or registering, press CREATE NEW APPLICANT
You can edit status of each applicant provided you have your superuser credentials inserted in js backend.

Thank You
