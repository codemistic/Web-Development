# CovidTimes

This is a covid patients stats website which uses an API to fetch the live number of covid patients in each every state of India . This website was created by the user @amey-SN during the lockdown times to help track the daily patient score and recovery rate .

This site uses php in the backend in order to setup this you would require XAMPP server and place these project files in the htcdocs folder .

Here is the link to get XAMPP
